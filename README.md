Our wonderful [Showcase SDK](https://matterport.github.io/showcase-sdk/) docs!

## How to update the docs
* Make a PR to master with the suggested changes!
* If it's a small change, typo etc, anyone on the Showcase team can approve and merge
* For medium-to-larger changes, e.g. adding a new function/feature, notify Todd and Victoria about the PR

The docs update whenever master is updated.
