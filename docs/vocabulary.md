:----:| ----------
Pano | Short for panorama. A spot in the Matterport Space where a user can ‘stand’ and look around. This includes 3D scan locations (panos aligned to each other) and 360º Views (unaligned panos).<br/><br/>A pano is the 2D visual data. This is different from 3D mesh data that the user sees in Dollhouse and Floorplan View.
UUID | Unique Universal ID. This is used to identify a single pano among the many panos in a Matterport Space.
Position | Absolute position (X, Y, and Z coordinates) of the pano within the Matterport Space. [Learn more](concepts.md) about the coordinate conventions.
Transition | Transitions are what the user sees when they move from one pano to another. Transitions can be: <ul><li>**Fly-through** — Flies from pano to pano inside the 3D Space.</li> <li>**Fade** — Fades to black in between panos. This gives a more “slideshow” type of feeling.</li> <li>**Instant** — Immediately switches from one pano to another without any transition.</li></ul>
Mode | The user’s current view in 3D Showcase. It can be one of three possible modes: <ul><li>Panorama <ul><li>Inside View (aligned pano). This corresponds to 3D Scan mode in the Capture app when the Matterport Space was captured.</li><li>360º View (unaligned pano)</li></ul><li>Dollhouse View</li><li>Floorplan View</li></ul>
