:----:| ----------
Pano or Sweep | Short for panorama. A spot in the Matterport Space where a user can stand and look around. Also called a 'sweep' as in a full Matterport camera rotation.<br/><br/>This includes 3D scan locations (panos aligned to each other) and 360º Views (unaligned panos).<br/><br/>A pano is the 2D visual data. This is different from 3D mesh data that the user sees in Dollhouse and Floorplan View.
UUID | Unique Universal ID. This is used to identify a single pano among the many panos in a Matterport Space.
Position | Absolute position (X, Y, and Z coordinates) of the pano within the Matterport Space. [Learn more](concepts.md) about the coordinate conventions.
Transition | Transitions are what the user sees when they move from one pano to another. Transitions can be: <br/>1) **Fly-through** — Flies from pano to pano inside the 3D Space. <br/>2) **Fade** — Fades to black in between panos. This gives a more “slideshow” type of feeling. <br/>3) **Instant** — Immediately switches from one pano to another without any transition.
Mode | The user’s current view in 3D Showcase. It can be one of five possible modes:<br/><br/>1) Inside View (aligned pano)<br/> 2) 360º View or Outside View (unaligned pano)<br/> 3) Dollhouse View<br/> 4) Floorplan View<br/> 5) Transitioning between different modes.
