# Introduction

The Matterport 3D Showcase SDK is a Javascript library for third-party developers to deeply integrate a Matterport Space into their web app.

With the SDK, developers can:

- **Execute actions** to control 3D Showcase from their web app
- **Listen to events** from 3D Showcase and respond in their web app

The SDK does not contain all the same actions and events that an end-user can do in 3D Showcase. We are building out the SDK based on developer demand.
