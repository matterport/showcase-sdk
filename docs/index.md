## Summary

The Matterport 3D Showcase SDK is a Javascript library for third-party developers. You can use it to add a Matterport Space to your website or web application at a *deeper level than a simple embed*.

Two types of abilities are available with the SDK:

- Control 3D Showcase from your web application by **executing actions**
- **Listen to events** from 3D Showcase and respond appropriately in your web app

Not everything in the normal, end-user version of 3D Showcase is available in the SDK. The current set of actions and events focus on the **user’s location in the Matterport space** and **taking screenshots**.
